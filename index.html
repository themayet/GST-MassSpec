		<div>The TripleTOF Service Training program consists of e-learning and instructor-led training. Some e-learning assignments must be completed by the trainee before they can attend the class. Other e-learning modules are reviewed as part of the class or will need to be completed after attending the class. The Training Program covers technology concepts, site installation inspection, installation, testing, maintenance, troubleshooting and repair of SCIEX TripleTOF systems at customer sites. The training will also provide basic knowledge and practice on the Triazine sample workflow and PeakView software required to view the data.

After the training the Field Service Engineer will know the different TripleTOF systems and associated peripherals, and will be able to visit customer sites to perform site inspections, installations, IQOQ validation, and planned maintenance of TripleTOF instruments. They will also be able to perform troubleshooting and repair of the TripleTOF systems as well some workflow support including installation of data processing computers and add-on software.
 ​

Out of scope tasks​
Advanced application support:This training program does not prepare the FSE to perform advanced application support that requires specialized knowledge of the customer’s samples, sample preparation techniques, workflows and software functionality.
Computer networking:This training program does not prepare the FSE to perform advanced computer support that requires specialized knowledge of IT systems, networks, computers, and software.
Basic TripleQuad training:The trainee should have knowledge of concepts such as ionization techniques; quadrupole ion transmission and filtering theory; interface and mass rail cleaning; planned maintenance; IQOQ validation. This knowledge should have been acquired through training and field service assignments on SCIEX TripleQuad and QTRAP instrumentation. Associated tasks and concepts are only practiced or discussed in this training as necessary to cover the differences for TripleTOF.
Ion Sources:Not covered are the TurboV source, PhotoSpray source, IonDrive source, SelexION, and 3rd party ion sources such as Advion.
Basic Analyst software training:Basic Analyst software training is not covered. The trainee should have knowledge of concepts such as Analyst software and PC card installation, and detailed understanding of the parameter functionality in the Parameter and Instrument Data tables.
Eksigent nanoLC systems:This training covers the installation and testing of the NanoSpray III and PicoView sources. It does not cover the installation, maintenance, troubleshooting and repair of nanoLC systems, which requires in-depth training and practice. This is covered in a different training program. Troubleshooting using an oscilloscope:An oscilloscope is used in this training to demonstrate several TripleTOF concepts. This is for clarification purposes only. Knowledge of troubleshooting the TripleTOF systems with an oscilloscope is not required and therefore not covered in this training.
Capillary Electrophoresis (CE):This training does not cover the connection and operation of CE systems to the TripleTOF.</div>

		<div>The X500 Series Service Training program consists of e-learning and instructor-led training. Some e-learning assignments must be completed by the trainee before they can attend the class. Other e-learning modules are reviewed as part of the class or will need to be completed after attending the class. The Training Program covers technology concepts, site installation inspection, installation, testing, maintenance, troubleshooting and repair of SCIEX X500 series systems at customer sites. The training will also provide basic knowledge and practice on sample workflows and software required to run samples and process data.

After the training the Field Service Engineer will know the different X500 series systems and associated peripherals, and will be able to visit customer sites to perform site inspections, installations, IQOQ validation, and planned maintenance of X500 series instruments. They will also be able to perform troubleshooting and repair of the X500 series systems as well as basic software and workflow support including installation of data processing computers and add-on software.

Out of scope tasks​
Advanced application support:This training program does not prepare the FSE to perform advanced application support that requires specialized knowledge of the customer’s samples, sample preparation techniques, workflows and software functionality.
Computer networking:This training program does not prepare the FSE to perform advanced computer support that requires specialized knowledge of IT systems, networks, computers, and software.
Basic TripleQuad training:The trainee should have knowledge of concepts such as ionization techniques; quadrupole ion transmission and filtering theory; interface and mass rail cleaning; planned maintenance; IQOQ validation. This knowledge should have been acquired through training and field service assignments on SCIEX TripleQuad and QTRAP instrumentation. Associated tasks and concepts are only practiced or discussed in this training as necessary to cover the differences for TripleTOF.
Ion Sources:Not covered are the TurboV source, PhotoSpray source, IonDrive source, SelexION, and 3rd party ion sources such as Advion.
Basic Analyst software training:Basic Analyst software training is not covered. The trainee should have knowledge of concepts such as Analyst software and PC card installation, and detailed understanding of the parameter functionality in the Parameter and Instrument Data tables.
Eksigent nanoLC systems:This training covers the installation and testing of the NanoSpray III and PicoView sources. It does not cover the installation, maintenance, troubleshooting and repair of nanoLC systems, which requires in-depth training and practice. This is covered in a different training program. Troubleshooting using an oscilloscope:An oscilloscope is used in this training to demonstrate several TripleTOF concepts. This is for clarification purposes only. Knowledge of troubleshooting the TripleTOF systems with an oscilloscope is not required and therefore not covered in this training.</div>
